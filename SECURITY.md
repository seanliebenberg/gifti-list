# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep Gifti List safe for everyone.

## Supported Versions

This project is in active development. Security fixes are released on the main branch and included in the next tagged release. We generally support the latest code on main.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security problems.

**Preferred:**

Use GitHub Security Advisories (private): go to the repo → Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability. This creates a private thread with the maintainer.

**What to include**

A clear description of the issue and impact

Minimal steps to reproduce (PoC)

Affected versions/commit SHAs, environment details

**Disclosure & timelines**

Acknowledgement within 48 hours

Initial assessment within 5 business days (incl. severity & scope)

Fix/mitigation target shared after triage (may vary by complexity)

Please withhold public disclosure until a fix is available. We will credit reporters (or keep you anonymous if you prefer).

**Scope**

We welcome reports for vulnerabilities in:

Application code and configuration

Build scripts and CI that affect supply chain security

Documentation that could lead to insecure usage

Out of scope: issues in third‑party dependencies where fixes must land upstream (you can still report; we’ll track and patch via updates).

**Contact & Language**

Reports in English or Dutch are welcome. If you need an alternative channel, propose one in your initial message.
